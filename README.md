Simply change PlayerBaseHM and PlayerBaseMA to the correct base pointer values. If you do not know how to get the base pointer values, I suggest looking it up on youtube or reading through the Cheat Engine tutorial.

The PlayerBaseXX values can be found within From1.cs on lines 25 and 26 respectively.

**Due to the pointer values not being static, an automatic pointer finder is probably not possible. If someone is able to do so, please enlighten me.
